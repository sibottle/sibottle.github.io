            <h5>UNFUNNY SERIOUSNESS BELOW!!!</h5>
            <div class="center spoiler" style="width: 90%; font-family:'Retro'">
              With all seriousness, this website just started off as a joke with Somedude234 making a small episode of
              Mario characters
              fighting because Mario didn't go to the church. The story goes something like:
              [Luigi notices that Mario hasn't gone to church in a bit, so he tells Mario to go to the church.
              But Mario tells him that it's his only day off. Luigi then calls Wario, the owner of Churchgame.com to
              tell Mario to go to church.]
              This whole website started when Somedude said Wario owned a website called Churchgame.com,
              so I began looking for ways to make a website and here we are.
              Oh, and by the way, we actaully do plan to make a show based on the episode i just told you.
              You're just gonna have to wait and see.. I've been having alot of fun making this website despite it
              literally taking up all my time
              at school. (lol) I've only learnt HTML recently and creating this website and hosting it has been a great
              learning experience
              for me. Despite the webpage on the inside being very flawed, I am still very happy with how it looks like.
